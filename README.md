# Digital Bank GO Application

Welcome to the Digital Bank GO application repository! This project serves as a comprehensive example of a digital banking application implemented in the GO programming language. It offers a valuable opportunity to explore object-oriented programming principles in GO, including the usage of references, pointers, methods, packages, composition, encapsulation, interfaces, and the modularization of the application into distinct packages. Dive into this codebase to enhance your understanding of these fundamental concepts in GO programming.

## Learning Topics

By studying this application, you can learn the following topics related to Go programming:

1. **Go: Object Orientation**: Gain insight into object-oriented programming principles in Go and how they are applied in this digital banking application.

2. **Learn Practical Usage of Structs**: Explore the practical usage of structs in Go to define custom data types.

3. **References, Pointers, and Methods**: Understand references, pointers, and methods in Go and how they are used to manipulate data.

4. **Returns, Packages, and Visibility**: Learn about Go's return values, packages, and visibility rules for variables and functions.

5. **Composition and Encapsulation**: Study the concepts of composition and encapsulation in Go, which help in building modular and maintainable code.

6. **Interfaces and New Account Types**: Discover how interfaces are used to define behavior and create new account types in the digital banking application.

7. **Improve Your Code by Modularization**: Enhance your code organization and structure by modularizing it into distinct packages, making it more readable and maintainable.

## Running the Application

To run the Digital Bank GO application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   This will execute the `main.go` script, which contains the digital banking application. The application will start, and you can interact with it to simulate various banking operations.
